Price check rules:
	1. If the pokemons have no price assigned you can just add one
           The pokemon's level have no influence on the price
           (even if the pokemon is 100 it have to be priced as it was low level no DC)
        
	2. If is already a price assigned and you are not okay with it just add a new one before the already existing separated with /
		Exemple: @       Caterpie|Lvl  15|25|25|28|20|27|27|Grass    |200m
		       > @       Caterpie|Lvl  15|25|25|28|20|27|27|Grass    |100k / 200m
           
	3. If is already a price assigned and you are oki with it just add a +before
		Exemple: @       Caterpie|Lvl  15|25|25|28|20|27|27|Grass    |100k / 200m
		       > @       Caterpie|Lvl  15|25|25|28|20|27|27|Grass    |+100k / 200m
           This allows to support a price placed by someone else,
           if more then one price is present the one with more + will be taken in consideration
	   
        4. The hidden power must be taken into consideration if and only if it is beneficial for the pokémon
           (Add * after the hidden power to show that it is taken in consideration while pricing)
           
        5. If the pokémon has no value you can just remove the @ instead of putting a price 0
           But that doesn't mean that cheap pokémons should be ignored
